## Overview

This project is a straight Monotouch port of the [Google Analytics SDK for Windows](https://googleanalyticssdk.codeplex.com).

The library assumes that you have a file **analytics.xml** in the root of your main project with its build action set to "Content". This presence of this file in your project is crucial. Please refer to the [documentation the Google Analytics SDK for Windows](https://googleanalyticssdk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20Started&referringTitle=Documentation) for further information about this file and for instructions on how to get started with the library. 

### Source Code Structure

Except for a minor addition of code for exctracting the iOS User-Agent, Everything under **GoogleAnalytics.Common** has been copied verbatim from the original project and should be updated and maintained accordingly.  
### Caveats

Since UIAppDelegate does not expose any .Net style application lifecycle events, you will need to call the associated methods (OnApplicationActivated and OnApplicationDeactivated) of the EasyTracker object yourself if you want to track the lifecycle using Google Analytics. 

The same applies to global handling of unhandled exceptions. You will have to wrap your app's Main() method with a try catch block and invoke EasyTracker.OnApplicationUnhandledException.
